# AirBnB-Project
Airbnb, Inc., based in San Francisco, California, operates an online marketplace focused on short-term homestays and experiences. The company acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.  The company has been criticized for possibly enabling increases in home rents,[4] refusing to provide sensitive customer data to governments, allowing listings in West Bank settlements, and it has been criticized by the hotel industry for not being subject to fair regulations
